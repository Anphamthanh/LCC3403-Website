          Students of Georgia Tech are smart and innovative, but they lack the experience and the tools to make
          changes. To become world class individuals, they have to live those experiences and develop those tools 
          within a learning environment that encourages them to act on their good ideas. To build students in these 
          ways, there are many projects that can be done to better Georgia Tech as a school that also offer students 
          the opportunity to develop these talents. Some example projects include rebuilding the t-square website, a 
          smartphone app for students to manage their classes, and a better system for providing real time locations 
          for our school buses and trolleys. During a student’s time at Georgia Tech, there could easily be a moment 
          that he or she realizes they have an implementable idea that redesigns on good infrastructure or effectively 
          and efficiently solves a recognized problem in education. How can we make these ideas transform into possible 
          projects for our students to implement? What can make these ideas become reality?

          As Georgia Tech currently is, it is difficult for students to join together and work on big projects because 
          of barriers such as time, authority, and funding. This is where the Committee for Innovation Advancement (CIA) 
          will be useful. The CIA has the ability to answer these questions and make positive changes for education here 
          at the institute in addition to possibly answering education issues worldwide.
          </p>
          <p>
          For many great new innovators there are factors that restrict them from implementing their ideas. From simply 
          not having the ability to see their ideas into real solutions or possible business ventures, to also lacking 
          the physical, financial and educational resources to get started. They need the time to implement, coordinate 
          and to test, evaluate as well as gain feedback from others.  These commitments can be at odds with existing 
          demands and expectations. For some students  they may lack skillsets required for the field in which they wish 
          to invest research. They may wish to test new concepts that require an initial financial investment, or 
          physical resources.  What occurs throughout this process are constant roadblocks between a great new idea and 
          the classroom that needs it.
          </p>
          <p>
          In the current reality, ideas fail, current methods become outdated, and our institute may fall behind in 
          demanding STEM majors. It would benefit both the institute and the student to offer the resources and 
          connections necessary to bridge the gaps between implementation and innovation, offer resources and connections necessary to see innovative concepts implemented in real world classrooms. Provide feedback to administrative staff that offer a clear and accurate measurement of education quality.
